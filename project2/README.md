What operating system and IDE you used to run and compile your code:
MacOS, Visual Studio Code + CMake Tools

Instructions for running your executables:
1. Place all .cpp and .h files along with a CMakeLists.txt file into a directory (i.e. called "project2")
2. Open "project2" in Visual Studio Code
3. Build "project2" using the "CMake Tools" extension
4. Run the program by first entering "./project2 " followed by the required command line arguments (please read the main file "target.cpp" for what arguments need to be passed)
5. Note: Every time you use a new feature type, new data needs to be written to a csv file. There is no implementation for clearing the csv file so the outputfile needs to be manually deleted and recreated.

Instructions for testing any extensions you completed:
No extensions completed
