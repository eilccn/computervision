2. Open "project3" in Visual Studio Code
3. Build "project3" using the "CMake Tools" extension
4. Run the program by first entering "./project3" followed by the path to the csv file 
5. Note: Every time you need to rebuild the program, the csv file needs to be manually deleted and recreated for it to build correctly.
